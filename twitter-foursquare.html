<h1>My Twitter account suspension</h1>

<p>On March 9, 2021 at 7:44 pm CST, while I was watching TV with my family, Twitter suspended my account (@willie) for posting 2 tweets (both at 7:44 pm CST) threatening violence against groups or individuals. I do not dispute the need for an automated temporary account suspension on Twitter's behalf.</p>

<p>I did not write or post the 2 abhorrent tweets in question.</p>

<p>How were these tweets posted to my account?</p>

<ul>
<li>both tweets were crossposted to Twitter via Foursquare.</li>
<li>my Foursquare/Swarm account was linked to my Twitter account around 11 years ago. I was surprised that the integration still worked.</li>
<li>someone unknown to me gained unauthorized access into:

<ul>
<li>my Foursquare account on the web on at 7:41 pm CST.</li>
<li>my Swarm account on iOS at 7:43 pm CST.</li>
<li>my Foursquare account on another web browser at 7:46 am. CST. The activity notification noted the time as 1:46 am GMT.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the tweets were cross-posted to Twitter at 7:44 pm CST.</li>
<li>I no longer have access to my Foursquare account. You can change the email and username of a Foursquare account without any token verification over email or text. It's disturbing.</li>
<li>I regretably had a weak and obvious Foursquare password.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm frustrated that I cannot delete these tweets from my suspended account timeline and I am disgusted by the racial slur contained in them. For those who saw the 2 tweets, it's obvious I did not write them as they do not reflect my writing style or activity over the past 14 years on Twitter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I am appealing my account suspension. I don't think my suspension should be permanent because I didn't write or post the tweets in question. I'm a victim of an attack and I think that is obvious from a causal review of my account.</p>

<p>My Twitter account is an important part of my life. I have made many in person friends as a result of Twitter interactions and it's an important source of news and information about my field. I would like my account restored.</p>

<h2>Some questions answered</h2>

<h3>Why did you have a weak password on Foursquare?</h3>

<p>There is no excuse, I should have known better. I had considered the financial impact of a Foursquare breach (none, no credit cards stored), but not potential collateral damage.</p>

<h3>How did you lose your Foursquare account?</h3>

<p>Apparently, if you know the password to a Foursquare account, you can change the email, username, and other things, without any token verification over email or text. As I mentioned, it's disturbing. I'm working with their support right now, and it's unclear what happened after the attackers logged and posted.</p>

<h3>Was your Twitter account secure?</h3>

<p>Yes and no: I had a complex password and 2FA set up. I thought it was secure, but I had not considered the backdoor aspect of third-party integrations, especially old ones. When I regain access to my account, I'll review (and likely) delete all of them.</p>
